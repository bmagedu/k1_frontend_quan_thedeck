                <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>The Deck is situated on the banks of the Saigon River, a short 15 minute journey from the heart of Ho Chi Minh City. It is the city’s most modern Pan Asian cuisine where friendships, romance and fine food comes together. Once you’ve been greeted by a smile, share the sunset, unwind with a signature cocktail and enjoy the contemporary experience it will be hard for you depart.</p>
                <h2>OUR TEAM</h2>
                <p>The Deck Saigon employs around 60 staff trained and supervised by an experienced western management team with over 50 years of combined experience in Vietnam. Anna Craven and Lawson Johnston have lived in Vietnam for over 20 years and are involved in developing restaurants, bars and a resort project.</p>
                <h2>OUR CHEFS</h2>
                <p>Our Executive Chef Cao Minh Lam joined The Deck pre-opening and now leads a professional team of 18 kitchen staff. He works closely with our Group Executive Chef Adrian Scott, a young, accomplished Chef who honed his skills in the UK and France before moving to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>We have a global menu incorporating a sharing contemporary Pan-Asian experience by the river on The Deck. It is modern and exciting, with weekly menu changes. Seafood is flown in directly from Phu Quoc island, vegetables come from Dalat and meat from Australia and the U.S. The menu is kept simple focusing on single ingredients of the finest quality.</p>
                <h2>OUR BAR</h2>
                <p>The bar is a chilled-out place to catch up with friends and unwind after work. Our Group Bar Manager, Banh Minh Nghia, is always on hand to welcome guests and to mix your favourite drink. Our staff prepare innovative and glamorous cocktails with favourites including Pair on the River and The Deck Signature Martinis.</p>
                <p>The Deck Saigon has a notable wine list representing some of the world’s major vineyards and fashionable wines.</p>
                <p>Our Grand Cru selection for the more discerning palate is extensive, with something for experts and novices alike.</p>
